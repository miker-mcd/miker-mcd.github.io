  As modern Western societies continue to learn more about the health risks and treatment of farm animals for meat consumption, substitutes are growing in popularity and quality. Gone are the days when tofu and veggie burgers were the only choices at your local grocer. Today's aisles offer plenty of delicious options for conscious shoppers including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tempeh</li>
  <li>Seitan</li>
  <li>Jackfruit</li>
</ul>
<p>Each option has its own unique characteristics and are sold in different varieties to fit into anyone's recipe rotation. A new fruit is on its way to join the meat substitute revolution.</p>
