  As modern Western societies continue to learn more about the health risks and treatment of farm animals for meat consumption, substitutes are growing in popularity and quality. Gone are the days when tofu and veggie burgers were the only choices at your local grocer. Today's aisles offer plenty of delicious options for conscious shoppers including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tempeh</li>
  <li>Seitan</li>
  <li>Jackfruit</li>
</ul>
<p>Each option has its own unique characteristics and are sold in different varieties to fit into anyone's recipe rotation. A new fruit is on its way to join the meat substitute revolution.</p>

<p>
  Breadfruit is a grape-fruit sized fruit from the breadfruit tree and originates from New Guinea. The tree seeds spread by way of exploration of the South Pacific and were recognized for their high-yielding benefits. When cooked the texture of the fruit is similar to baked bread, thus giving the fruit its name. A sort of cousin of Jackfruit, Breadfruit tastes like a potato when ripe and is used as an ingredient in the same ways as potatoes.

  <li><a href="http://ntbg.org/breadfruit/breadfruit/">ntbg.org</a>: This website is very informative and is consistent with use of colors and text. The site is pretty confusing to navigate as there are layers of navigation bars and links throughout the page. As much as it is consistent, I think it could be more dynamic with the user.</li>
  <li><a href="http://globalbreadfruit.com/">globalbreadfruit.com</a>: This website has a nice modern layout with readable text and nice imagery. I think the site conveys their organization's purpose well. I think this is a good website and I would only change some of the styling with links and the paragraphs.</li>
