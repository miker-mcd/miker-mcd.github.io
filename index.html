<h3>What Is Breadfruit?</h3>
<p>
  Breadfruit is a grape-fruit sized fruit from the breadfruit tree and originates from New Guinea. The tree seeds spread by way of exploration of the South Pacific and were recognized for their high-yielding benefits. When cooked the texture of the fruit is similar to baked bread, thus giving the fruit its name. A sort of cousin of Jackfruit, Breadfruit tastes like a potato when ripe and is used as an ingredient in the same ways as potatoes.
